    '''
    This function process acceleration history for NGA data file (.AT2 format)
    to a single column value and return the total number of data points and 
    time iterval of the recording.
    Parameters:
    ------------
    filepath : string (location and name of the file)
    scalefactor : float (Optional) - multiplier factor that is applied to each
                  component in acceleration array.
    
    Output:
    ------------
    desc: Description of the earthquake (e.g., name, year, etc)
    npts: total number of recorded points (acceleration data)
    dt: time interval of recorded points
    time: array (n x 1) - time array, same length with npts
    inp_acc: array (n x 1) - acceleration array, same length with time
             unit usually in (g) unless stated as other.
    
    Example: (plot time vs acceleration)
    filepath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'motion_1')
    desc, npts, dt, time, inp_acc = processNGAfile (filepath)
    plt.plot(time,inp_acc)
